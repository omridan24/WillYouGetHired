# WillYouGetHired
**Welcome to Group 19's Data Analysis Project!**

In this project, we explore the relationship between various statistical measures and the rate of acceptance into employment opportunities. 

**Key Information:**

1. **Code and Analysis:** The "AreYouIn.py" file contains all of our code, including the statistical research.
2. **Documentation:**  Each line of code is thoroughly documented and explained for easy understanding.
3. **Visualizations:** The "Graphs.py" file houses all of our graphs (some of which are also featured in the slideshow). 
4. **Independent Graph Viewing:** You can run "Graphs.py" separately from "AreYouIn.py" to focus solely on the visualizations. 
5. **No Console Output:** When running "AreYouIn.py", you won't see any printed output. Results are documented within the file itself and presented in the slideshow.
6. **Results:** The outcomes of each research question are documented within the respective code files.

**We hope you find our project insightful!**
